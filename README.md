###The Bright Idea   

To create an application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. Unfortunately, we got too much information in a very short period and I do not feel myself comfortable enough yet to put tools and methodologies together. 


### Solution

I decided to create a personal tabata application that would allow users to create own blocks of exercises or use automatically pre-assigned routines, as well as add or remove poses from each routine.

There should be option to choose between exercises with or without weight. Also preliminary plan had optional interval timer and calories counter.

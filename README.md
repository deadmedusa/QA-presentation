### The Bright Idea  

To create an application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. Unfortunately, we got too much information in a very short period and I still do not feel myself comfortable enough yet to put tools and methodologies together. 

### Solution
I decided to create a personal tabata application that would allow users to create own blocks of exercises or use automatically pre-assigned routines, as well as add or remove exercises from each routine.

There should be option to choose between exercises with or without weight. Also preliminary plan had optional interval timer and calories counter.

Couple cups of tea helped me to create initial plan what might want potential users, who suddenly decided to lose weight or increase stamina.

### Architecture

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

The initial ERD consisted four tables but number was reduced for final solution. 

All tables are coloured based on importance for final project.

Additional features of the application can be added on a later stage after main application will go live. 

### Risk assessment

Project includes short initial risk assessment

Most risk factors are technical and related to application security but impact is low, because there is no plans to collect users' personal data.

### The Bright Idea  

To create an application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. Unfortunately, we got too much information in a very short period and I do not feel myself comfortable enough yet to put tools and methodologies together. 


### Solution

I decided to create a personal tabata application that would allow users to create own blocks of exercises or use automatically pre-assigned routines, as well as add or remove poses from each routine.

There should be an option to choose between exercises with or without weight. Also preliminary plan had optional interval timer and calories counter.

Couple cups of tea helped me to create initial ideas what might want potential users, who decided to lose weight or increase stamina.

### Architecture

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

The initial ERD consisted four tables but number was reduced for final solution. 

All tables are coloured based on importance for final project.

Additional features of the application can be added at any time on a later stage after main application will go live.
